Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the playtesting source code for the game server of [Pokémon Infinite Showdown][4], a mechanical replica of our eventual fangame. This metagame makes sweeping changes that are major attempts to balance the game as a whole.  You can find a list of these changes here: https://tinyurl.com/y2v9n2p9



Browser support
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pokémon Showdown currently supports, in order of preference:

 - Chrome
 - Firefox
 - Opera
 - Safari 5+
 - IE11+
 - Chrome/Firefox/Safari for various mobile devices

Pokémon Infinite Showdown is usable, but expect degraded performance and certain features not to work in:

 - Safari 4+
 - IE9+

Pokémon Infinte Showdown is mostly developed on Chrome, and Chrome or the desktop client is required for certain features like dragging-and-dropping teams from PS to your computer. However, bugs reported on any supported browser will usually be fixed pretty quickly.


Community
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, there will be an open public discord to discuss competitive and actual aspects of Pokemon Infinite.  For now, if you want to be involved with the project, contact SolaceAcheron or ProjectPokemonInfinite on Twitter.
